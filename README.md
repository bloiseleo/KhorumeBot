# KhorumeBot

The original bot can be found [here](https://github.com/brunofunnie/chorumebot).

ChorumeBot is a Discord Bot built by the Chorume Community that was originally written in PHP. It became very popular when it was used to bet Chorume Coins (Fake Digital Coin) in UFC fights during weekend nights and roulette bets.  Now, we are rewritting it in Java Technologies in order to learn more about Java, Kotlin and other tools related to Java
